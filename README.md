# simple-go-auth
Simple go authentication and authorization with JWT

I wrote based on [this](https://dev.to/behalf/authentication-authorization-in-microservices-architecture-part-i-2cn0) with some enhacement.

- Build with `make` command
- Run with: `./bin/go-auth`
- Update environment params in `.env` to run with another port/redis credential/secret keys.

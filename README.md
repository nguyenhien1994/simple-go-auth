# simple-go-auth
Simple go authentication and authorization with JWT

I wrote based on [this](https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2020/03/13/using-jwt-for-authentication-in-a-golang-application-dr/) with some enhancement.

- Build with `make` command
- Run with: `./bin/go-auth`
- Update environment params in `.env` to run with another port/redis credential/secret keys.
